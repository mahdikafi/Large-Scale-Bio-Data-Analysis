PART0: basics 

 

Generating random genome and random reads

 

GOAL1: write a function to generate a random genome with a given length

GOAL2: write a function to generate random reads with given length and numbers

GOAL3: write simulated genome and reads in a file

 

 

 

PART1: simulate a dna fragmentation with enzyme or sonication 

 

Write a function in R with the following inputs:

1- Genome

2- Number of Fragments

3- Mean of Fragments

4- Variance of Fragments

 

The output is a list of fragments sampled from a normal distribution with specified strands

 

GOAL1: Plot a histogram of fragment lengths. 

 

 

 

PART2: simulate PCR

 

Write a function in R with the following inputs:

1- output of fragments

2- Lambda_min

3- Lambda_max

4- modes

 

The output is the number of copies for each fragment. Modes accepts two cases: in case one the copies are drawn from a poisson distribution with lambda_min. In case two the copies are sampled from poisson distribution with lambdas uniformly selected from Lambda_min and Lambda_max.

 

 

GOAL1: Predict the complexity of a given library from N samples from single end reads

GOAL2: Predict the complexity of a given library from N samples from paired end reads

GOAL3: Plot Coverage vs number of samples from single end reads

GOAL4: Predict if adding more reads with increase the coverage
