PART0: basics 

 

We work on three genomes all having same size as ECOLI

 

GENOME 1: a random genome of  ecoli genome size

GENOME 2: ecoli

GENOME 3: a part of human chromosome 20 starting from 20Mbp and having the same size as ecoli genome.

 

1-  write a program and prepare all these genomes

 

2- Write a program that generates reads from a genome with a given error rate. (Consider only substitution errors)

 

3 - Write a program that assembles genomes from a given set of reads ( you may only call available packages such as velvet).

 

 

PART1: DENOVO Assembly 

 

Compare the performance of the denovo assembly based on the following variables.

 

1- Genome size

2- Number of reads

3- Read length

4- Error rate in reads

 

GOAL1: Plot N50 vs coverage depth.

GOAL2: Plot N50 vs error rate. 

GOAL3: compare the three genomes.

 

 

 

PART2: RESEQUENCING

 

Consider the three genomes as reference genomes and create three new genomes with some mutations inserted. Mutations include substitutions and short indels. Write a program that calls variations from reads and a reference genome. ( you may use short read mapping such as bowtie)

 

 

GOAL1: Compare the performance of variant calling for different read length ( starting from 20 bp up to 200 bp)

GOAL2: Compare the performance of variant calling for different mutation rates

GOAL3: Compare the performance of variant calling if only indels do exist.

GOAL4: How much coverage is needed to call all the variant perfectly?
